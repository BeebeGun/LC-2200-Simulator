# LC-2200-Simulator
Project for Junior Design at Georgia Tech


# How to Compile / Develop
Install Scala, SBT, and Java/JavaFX.

You can then run "sbt run" to have SBT take care of building and running the application.
Note that this project uses ScalaFX, which will be automatically downloaded by SBT, as it is a dependency in the build.sbt file,
but ScalaFX depends on JavaFX, but does nothing to install JavaFX.
